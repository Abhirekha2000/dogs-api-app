# Dogs — Fetch, Promises & Async/Await (React)

This is my implementation of the "Dogs, JavaScript & An API" tutorial adapted to React.  
It uses the Dog CEO API (https://dog.ceo) to fetch dog images by breed and present them in a slideshow.

## Credits
This project follows the excellent tutorial by **Brad Schiff**. Full credit to Brad Schiff for the original tutorial and learning guidance.

## How to run
1. `npm install`
2. `npm run dev` (development)
3. `npm run build` then deploy `dist/` to a static host
